## Introduction
This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) application built with Next.js using the App Router. It demonstrates how to integrate the PokeAPI to fetch Pokémon data and display it with server-side pagination using Material-UI (MUI) components. The primary goal is to showcase efficient data fetching, filtering, and pagination techniques in a modern React framework.

## 🔥 Features
- Server-side rendering with Next.js for improved performance and SEO.
- Integration with PokeAPI to fetch Pokémon data.
- Server-side pagination using MUI’s DataGrid component.
- Dynamic search functionality to filter Pokémon by name.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.

## 🤖 Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-rendered applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
